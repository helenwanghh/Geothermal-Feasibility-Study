### Geothermal Project
---

**Objective**
The objective is to create computational models to study the feasibility and energy cost of using geothermal to supplement the cooling thermal management of buildings on campus (including ice rink)

**Framework**
•	choose to use the type of roof of their building as well as the footprint of the roof. 
•	The weather data is limited to Burlington Jan 1, 2021 to Dec 31, 2021 (data provided)
•	Goals:
1.	Identify the cooling demand for a fixed ceiling temperature (T = 20 C)
2.	Derive the necessary geothermal system to deliver the required cooling demand
3.	The energy cost to move fluid within the geothermal loop
4.	Extend the analysis to a more realistic room heat transfer model (code provided) and compare the overall cooling demand for a room of height 5m compared to your initial calculation
5.	Discuss which model does a better job at predicting heat load and why. Does it change your design of the geothermal heat exchanger?


 **Assumptions**
•	Ground is assumed to be at 10C at 2m deep
•	Soil can be sand or clay
•	For the heat exchange between soil and piping study two possibilities: 
o	Option 1: The outside surface is at soil temperature in the heat exchanger
o	Option 2: Introduce a parametric distance at which the soil is at 10C from the surface of the pipe. Study the effect of that distance on the pipe length
•	Recommended material for piping is HDPE
•	The heat exchanger is assumed to require cool temperature of 12C and return temperature of 22C. Efficacy is estimated at 0.75
•	When using the model building, use an indoor temperature of 20C

**Deliverables**

- Cooling demand for a model building of your choice and Recommendation for geothermal heat exchanger dimensions
- Refinement of model building heat load simulation
- Final report due as group, equations  for the room (individual submission)
